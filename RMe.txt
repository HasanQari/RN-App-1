------------ Notes ------------

- in <View> tag can be nested
- Flexbox is: a concept/ set of styling properties that allow you to structure content (i.e. create layouts)
- The default styling/ layout behavior of a <View> component is: it use flexbox to organize its child components 
    <View> has flexDirection: 'column' (which is the default) 
- will add a style as a dynamic way {for style{for code from Js}} -> <View style={{}}>
- activeOpscity is attribute that show motion effect when click on button it come with <Touchable> Tag


- What to Debug?
    3 type of debug/error: 
        1- error messages or app crashes --> red box show that is you error 
            @ syntax error / missing code or value
            @ bug in code --ex. use undefined value wroung types ...
            @ unavidable error *must fase it* --ex. network request error / missing filesystem / blocked permition
        2- logical error --> work but it doesn't work fine (working incorrect) output but the app is work 
            @ undesired or unexpected app behavior
            @ unhandled user behavior --> user use app in way didn't intend
            @ may user follow sequence of step that leads to errors
        3- UI and UX error --> somethings doesn't look fine 
            @ unexpected errors *wrong in style code* or layout
            @ inconsistent result on different devices *responsivity of app*
            @ work fine on Android but not on IOS --ex.
- how to debug?
    @ read errors messages *most people don't read it!* --> error message sometime contain the solution or part of it 
    @ googling about error messages
    @ feel about value, var. and use console.log to check about a value *efficants with simple code not for complex code*
    @ for very hard and copmlex error use *Chrome Debugger(+ Breakpoints / DevTool)* tool it supported with RN 
        the tool dive into the code in details and step by step.
    @ with expo debugger on real device with shake the device a little
